           <p>4.2 iStore takes extensive steps to ensure that all transactions are secure. All transactions made through the Website are encrypted. You acknowledge that transactions that are performed over the internet may be vulnerable to being intercepted. iStore will not be liable for any loss that you way suffer as a result of any interception.</p>
           <p>4.3 Where payment is made by credit card, iStore may require additional information in order to authorise and/or verify the validity of payment. In such cases we are entitled to withhold delivery until such time as the additional information is received by us and authorisation is obtained by us for the amounts. If we do not receive authorisation your order for the products will be cancelled. You warrant that you are fully authorised to use the credit card supplied for purposes of paying the products. You also warrant that your credit card has sufficient available funds to cover all the costs incurred as a result of the services used on the Website.</p>
           <p>4.4 iStore reserves the right at any time and without giving you any advance notice to make changes to the prices of goods and to correct any pricing errors that may inadvertently occur.</p>
           <p>4.5 Some products are not necessarily available in all stores and the prices on this Website may vary in-store from time to time, therefore iStore cannot guarantee that any particular product will be available at the price displayed on this website in-store.</p>

           <h3>Payflex</h3>
          <p>4.6 To apply for your Payflex account, select Payflex as your payment method at checkout, provide your ID number, cellphone number, email address, and Payflex will assess your application. Make sure that all these details are correct and only belong to you.</p>
          <p>4.7 Payflex does not guarantee acceptance to the Pay-Later Service and reserves the right to decline your request for the Pay-Later Service at their sole discretion, even if you have previously used the Pay-Later Service and paid your instalments in full and on time for other transactions.</p>
          <p>4.8 In order to be eligible to use Payflex as a payment method, you are required to be over the age of 18, have a South African-issued Visa or Mastercard debit, cheque, or credit card, currently reside in South Africa and have a good credit history.</p>
          <p>4.9 Payflex will require the first payment to be paid upfront and your goods will be delivered as per our existing delivery times for your region. After that, the next three (3) payments will be deducted every two (2) weeks, over six (6) weeks, through an automatic debit from your bank card. So, make sure to have funds in your account on that date to honour the payment and avoid any late fees.</p>
          <p>4.10 If the price of the product you want to purchase is more than the spend limit Payflex has given you, this is considered a “Heavy Basket”. In this scenario you will pay the full excess amount that is above what you qualify for from Payflex upfront as the first instalment and the spend limit that you have qualified for will be split over the last 3 instalments.
                 <p> For example, if your spend limit is R3000.00 and you wish to buy something for R10,000, your instalments would be as below:</p>
                    <p>Payment 1: R7,000.00</p>

                     <p>Payment 2: R1,000.00</p>

                    <p>Payment 3: R1,000.00</p>

                    <p>Payment 4: R1,000.00</p>

         <p>4.11 The Payflex instalment displayed on the web site is illustrative only and assumes your spend limit is sufficient to cover the full cost of the product to be purchased.</p>
         <p>4.12 No fees or interest will be charged in respect of the Instalment Plan, provided that all Instalment Payments are paid in accordance with the Instalment Plan. Payflex may charge default interest on any overdue amount (excluding Default Fees) once the Instalment Plan is deemed to be an incidental credit agreement in accordance with the NCA.</p>
         <p>4.13 The maximum you can spend with Payflex depends on your individual Payflex assessment.</p>
         <p>4.14 You can use any Visa, Mastercard, American Express (debit, credit, or cheque) to make a Payflex payment.</p>
         <p>4.15 You are liable for any fees or costs that your bank may charge you when payment is made using your Card.</p>
         <p>4.16 You can make a manual payment at any time by logging in to your Payflex customer portal.</p>

         <h3>Float</h3>
         <p>4.17 Float is a checkout payment solution that enables shoppers to split purchases into interest-free, fee-free monthly instalments</p>
         <p>4.18 Customer's can only use their existing Visa or Mastercard credit card. Debit Cards will not be accepted.</p>
         <p>4.19 Credit is solely dependant on funds available in your Visa or Mastercard credit card.</p>
         <p>4.20 Float does not impose further minimum or maximum order value.</p>
         <p>4.21 Payment terms will range between 2 - 6 months for products purchased on the iStore website.</>
         <p>4.22 Float may place a pre-authorisation (also known as a “reserve”) as a temporary hold against the credit you have available to spend on your credit card. This is not a charge and is interest-free.</p>
         <p>4.23 Float payment method is available online only on the www.istore.co.za website.</p>
         <p>4.24 Float payment method cannot be used to purchase any of the iPhone devices.</p>
         <p>4.25 All returns and refunds to be processed using the existing iStore returns policy. Once finalised, Float will adjust your instalment plan or refund money back to you accordingly based on the existing policy.</p>
